Welcome to my website. I am a Senior Economist at the Asian Development Bank (ADB). My current work focuses on developing applications of GIS and big data analytics to improve poverty estimation at a geographically granular level, inform the spatial targeting of investments, and understand the distributional impact of policy interventions.

Prior to my career at ADB, I worked as a Senior Economist at the World Bank and as a Postdoctoral Fellow at AidData, a development research lab at the College of William & Mary. I received a Ph.D. in Political Science from Cornell University in 2015.
